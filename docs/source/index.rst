Welcome to MAFRA mobile data collection app documentation!
==========================================================

The MAFRA project also known as *Statistics from Space* 

The ITC component of the MAFRA project, also known as Statistics from Space, aims at
addressing challenges in conducting agricultural statistics by <br>
  - developing and testing a novel remote
sensing-based method for sample frame design and 
  - developing and
testing a method to efficiently account for the land use within each
sample area
  - developing and testing the required tools to collect,
quality control and share the resulting spatial data and agricultural
statistics. 
  - perform analytics on the resulting spatial data.

**** (/The app/ builds on) .
The mobile data collection application is built on the
[Qfield architecture](https://https://qfield.org)
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.
